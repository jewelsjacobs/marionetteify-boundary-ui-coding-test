# Boundary UI Coding Test With [Marionette / Browserify TodoMVC](https://github.com/JSteunou/marionetteify)

After trying to clean up the original Marionette Backbone TodoMVC by adding a grunt build pipeline with browserify and karma, jasmine, tdd and linting I realized I was taking too long and not making a lot of progress.

I found [this](https://github.com/JSteunou/marionetteify) and decided to fork it instead.  I hope it's clean enough so it's not too painful to read.
